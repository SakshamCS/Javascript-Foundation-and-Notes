//Basic array -
const jonasArray = [
    'Jonas',
    'Schemdtmann',
    2024-1991,
    'Teacher',
    ['Michael', 'Peter', 'Steven']
];

//To give these elements name we have another data structure called object
//In objects we define key value pairs

//Object -
const jonas = {
    firstName : 'Jonas',
    lastName : 'Schemdtmann',
    age : 2024-1991,
    job : 'Teacher',
    friends : ['Michael', 'Peter', 'Steven']
};
//Key is basically a variable i.e firstName here for eg. and the value is 'Jonas' and the value can be of any type that we want here
//Each of these keys is also called a property
//So basically this object named jonas has 5 properties

//So creating the object by the use of {} is the most easiest way of creating object and it is called "Object Literal Syntax" because we are literally writing down all the object content.

//The difference between objects and arrays-
//is that in object the order of these elements doesn't matter when we want to retrieve them.
//But in arrays order matters a lot we can only access the elements using their order no. that means we should use arrays for more ordered data.
//And objects for more unstructured data and data that we actually want ot name and retrieve based on that name.
